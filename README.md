# Friends of Presta

This repository presents Friends of Presta community, its missions, intents and publics.

## People

We are PrestaShop integrators and developers, working together on modules, themes and additional resources.

> Is this organization and its differents channels open for merchants and complete beginners?

No, please refers to the official forum of PrestaShop if you're a merchant or to the official User or Developers documentations if you need to learn PrestaShop basics.

## What we do

We want a space to share resources, tips and help each other.
Everything provided here is free and open source, if you need a commercial support consider to contact someone on our [Slack community](http://friends-of-presta.slack.com).

## About the PrestaShop company

We're not related in any way to the PrestaShop company and - so on - this organization is not administrated by PrestaShop employees.
You may meet some PrestaShop employees on the Slack, but keep in mind that official developer channel is on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PrestaShop/General).

## Code of Conduct

As for now, you can consider that we will follow the PrestaShop community Code of Conduct once they will publish it. 

## Coding conventions

As for now, the modules and code samples should follow [Prestashop coding standards](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/coding-standards/) ( PSR-2 standard, Symfony standards, ...) and naming convention but it's not absolutely required : usefull stuff first.
PHP CS Fixer with prestashop settings can be used.
